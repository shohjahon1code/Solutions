# [2119. A Number After a Double Reversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/a-number-after-a-double-reversal/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

**Reversing** an integer means to reverse all its digits.

- For example, reversing `2021` gives `1202`. Reversing `12300` gives `321` as the **leading zeros are not retained**.

Given an integer `num`, **reverse** num to get `reversed1`, **then reverse** `reversed1` to get `reversed2`. Return `true` if `reversed2` equals `num`. Otherwise return `false`.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: num = 526
Output: true
Explanation: Reverse num to get 625, then reverse 625 to get 526, which equals num.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: num = 1800
Output: false
Explanation: Reverse num to get 81, then reverse 81 to get 18, which does not equal num.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: num = 0
Output: true
Explanation: Reverse num to get 0, then reverse 0 to get 0, which equals num.
```

## Constraints:

- `0 <= num <= 10^6`


## Solutions

### O(n) solution

#### Python3 

```javascript
var isSameAfterReversals = function(num) {
    var reverse = function(number) {
        var result = 0;
        while (number) {
            result = result * 10 + number % 10;
            number = Math.floor(number / 10);
        }
        return result;
    };
    return reverse(reverse(num)) === num;
};
```

The given solution solves the problem by defining a helper function `reverse` that takes a number as input and reverses its digits. It then checks if the final reversed number is equal to the original number and returns `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise.

The algorithm follows these steps:
1. Define a helper function `reverse` that takes a number as input and reverses its digits. This function uses a variable `result` initialized to 0.
2. Inside the `reverse` function, enter a while loop that continues as long as the input number is non-zero.
3. Inside the while loop, calculate the next digit of the reversed number by using the expression `result = result * 10 + number % 10`, where `number % 10` gives the last digit of the number and `result * 10` shifts the existing digits to the left.
4. Divide the input number by 10 using the floor division operator `number //= 10` to remove the last digit.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until the input number becomes zero.
6. After defining the `reverse` function, return the result of the expression `reverse(reverse(num)) == num`, which checks if the final reversed number is equal to the original number.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(D), where D is the number of digits in the input number. This is because the algorithm reverses the digits of the number twice using the `reverse` function, which takes O(D) time.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of additional space to store the `result` variable.

#### Summary

The given solution checks if an integer is equal to the result of reversing it twice. The algorithm reverses the digits of the number using the `reverse` function and compares the final reversed number with the original number. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(D) and a space complexity of O(1), where D is the number of digits in the input number.

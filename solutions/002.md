# [9. Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

## Constraints:

- `-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`

## Follow up:

Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

## Solutions

### O(n) solution

#### Python3
```python3
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if x < 0:
            return False

        number, reverse, counter = x, 0, 0
        while True:
            reverse = reverse * 10 + number % 10
            number = number // 10
            counter += 1
            if not number:
                break
        return x == reverse
```

The given solution solves the problem by first checking if `x` is negative. If `x` is negative, it immediately returns `False` since a negative number cannot be a palindrome. If `x` is non-negative, the solution uses a while loop to reverse the digits of `x` and stores the reversed number in the variable `reverse`. Finally, it compares `x` with `reverse` and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating that `x` is a palindrome, or `False` otherwise.

The algorithm follows these steps:
1. Check if `x` is negative. If it is, return `False` immediately since negative numbers cannot be palindromes.
2. Initialize variables `number`, `reverse`, and `counter` to `x`, 0, and 0, respectively.
3. Enter a while loop that continues until the loop condition is explicitly broken.
4. Inside the while loop, calculate the next digit of the reversed number by using the expression `reverse = reverse * 10 + number % 10`, where `number % 10` gives the last digit of `number` and `reverse * 10` shifts the existing digits to the left.
5. Divide `number` by 10 using the floor division operator `number //= 10` to remove the last digit.
6. Increment the `counter` by 1 to keep track of the number of digits processed.
7. Check if `number` is zero. If it is, break the while loop.
8. Repeat steps 4-7 until the loop condition is explicitly broken.
9. Compare `x` with `reverse`. If they are equal, return `True` to indicate that `x` is a palindrome; otherwise, return `False`.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(D), where D is the number of digits in the input number `x`. This is because the algorithm iterates through each digit of `x` in the while loop, performing constant-time operations.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of additional space to store the `number`, `reverse`, and `counter` variables.

#### Summary

The given solution determines whether the given integer `x` is a palindrome or not. It first checks if `x` is negative, and if it is, it immediately returns `False`. If `x` is non-negative, the algorithm reverses the digits of `x` and compares it with the original number to determine if `x` is a palindrome. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(D) and a space complexity of O(1), where D is the number of digits in `x`.
